The Case with Nine Solutions

As a writer of detective stories, the distinguished Irishman who signs 
himself "J. J. Connington" has rapidly arrived in the first rank. "The 
Case with Nine Solutions" is an intriguing as its title promises. Early 
in the book a number of deaths occur, and by the sixth chapter the 
exposition is finished and the record of crime almost complete. Nine 
different solutions are propounded and then---amid every circumstance, not
only of intellectual, but also of physical, excitement---comes the 
elimination of the eight erroneous solutions, until the right one is 
finally achieved.
Mr. Connington's latest proof that he is a master of detective 
architecture preserves honestly the first rule of the game: every clue 
is presented as it is discovered by the police, so that the reader can 
compete with the detective in that breath-taking race towards the 
solution of the mystery.
