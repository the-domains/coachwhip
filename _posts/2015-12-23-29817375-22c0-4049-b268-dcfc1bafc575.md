Ellery Queen was both fictional 
detective and literary pseudonym, first published in 1929 by cousins 
Frederic Dannay and Manfred Lee. Ellery Queen starred in over 30 novels 
and short story collections, along with a popular radio show, several 
television adaptations and numerous films.

This volume collects the three 
Dell Four Color comics (published in 1961 and 1962) in the Ellery Queen,
Detective, set. This was the fourth appearance of Ellery Queen in comic
book format.

The stories included are "The 
Mummy's Curse," "The Underwater Clue," "The Missing Man," "A False 
Alibi," "The Witch's Victim," "The Voodoo Victim," and "The Curse of 
Kane."
