![The Case with Nine Solutions (J. J. Connington)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/33b5ec3312aa394bd910e5eda8c078ecdc90a844.jpg)

The Case with Nine Solutions

As a writer of detective stories, the distinguished Irishman who signs himself "J. J. Connington" has rapidly arrived in the first rank. "The Case with Nine Solutions" is an intriguing as its title promises. Early in the book a number of deaths occur, and by the sixth chapter the exposition is finished and the record of crime almost complete. Nine different solutions are propounded and then---amid every circumstance, not only of intellectual, but also of physical, excitement---comes the elimination of the eight erroneous solutions, until the right one is finally achieved.
Mr. Connington's latest proof that he is a master of detective architecture preserves honestly the first rule of the game: every clue is presented as it is discovered by the police, so that the reader can compete with the detective in that breath-taking race towards the solution of the mystery.
