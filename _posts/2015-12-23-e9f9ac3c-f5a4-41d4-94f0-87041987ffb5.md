![Mystery at Lynden Sands (J. J. Connington)](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2fc9127ce2803cce7215bf36f3b8079dc51b8029.jpg)

Mystery at Lynden Sands

Mr. Connington has written several detective stories of a high order and one---Murder in the Maze---which ranks with the best thrillers in recent years. His latest tale is certainly on the same high level.
The mysterious death of a caretaker; the burglary of the mansion left in his charge; a murder on the beach, which throws suspicion on one character after another; an apparently motiveless attack upon a visitor; the appearance of a claimant to an estate; a case of kidnapping; and a line of footprints in the sands which breaks off as though the walker had vanished into the air---these are some of the elements out of which the story has been built.
As in his earlier works, the author plays quite fair with his readers; everything is satisfactorily accounted for; and all the evidence is given which is required for the solution of the complex problem confronting the detectives.
